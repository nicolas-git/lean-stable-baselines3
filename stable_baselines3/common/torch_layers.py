    Constructs an MLP that receives the output from a previous features extractor (i.e. a CNN) or directly
    the observations (if no features extractor is applied) as an input and outputs a latent representation
    for the policy and a value network.

    The ``net_arch`` parameter allows to specify the amount and size of the hidden layers.
    It can be in either of the following forms:
    1. ``dict(vf=[<list of layer sizes>], pi=[<list of layer sizes>])``: to specify the amount and size of the layers in the
        policy and value nets individually. If it is missing any of the keys (pi or vf),
        zero layers will be considered for that key.
    2. ``[<list of layer sizes>]``: "shortcut" in case the amount and size of the layers
        in the policy and value nets are the same. Same as ``dict(vf=int_list, pi=int_list)``
        where int_list is the same for the actor and critic.

    .. note::
        If a key is not specified or an empty list is passed ``[]``, a linear network will be used.

    :param feature_dim: Dimension of the feature vector (can be the output of a CNN)
    :param net_arch: The specification of the policy and value networks.
        See above for details on its formatting.
